# GroverAlgorithmQuanticComputing
In this repository is the code for doing a classic and a Quantum search in an unordered list.
It's a code in python using the Qiskit library. You can modify the number you want to look for by changing the value asociated to the variable marked element, and the length of the list is going to be n-1, so if you want to look for a number in a list of 1024 numers (2^10), n has to be eleven.
